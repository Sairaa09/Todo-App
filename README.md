## 📖 Overview

**Todo App (React)** is a sleek, simple, and fast productivity tool to manage your daily tasks — built entirely with **React**, styled using **CSS Modules**, and bundled with **Vite** for lightning-fast development.

It uses **LocalStorage** to persist tasks even after page refreshes, so you never lose track of your goals!
